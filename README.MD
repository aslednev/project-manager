# Project Manager

## Description

Project Manager is a comprehensive command line application, developed in Go. This versatile tool implements a wide range of operational functionalities, which are essential for efficient project management and maintenance, especially in larger coding environments with extensive systems.

The primary utilities included in this project include:

1. `scan`: This function facilitates system scanning by relying on parameters set in the configuration file. This can be used to identify and analyze relevant system elements and attributes.

2. `checkout`: This utility streamlines project version management by executing the checkout command in Git, enabling developers to switch effortlessly between different repository branches.

3. `sync`: This function performs system synchronization based on the configuration file parameters. It's useful for aligning parts of the system or ensuring consistency across different project components.

4. `build`: This feature is critical for any project as it engages the build process for specific areas of the project, as defined by the configuration file parameters. It turns source code into a format that can be executed by the system.

5. `provision`: This function prepares a specific portion of the system in alignment with the specifications of the configuration file. It's often used to setup and manage the state of infrastructure, making it ready for use.

6. `run`: This utility executes user-specified scripts within the project context. It's a vital function for testing code snippets, performing certain repetitive tasks, or any defined operations in the project environment.

Each of these utilities has been designed and implemented with a focus on automating and streamlining workflows, significantly improving the efficiency of managing projects, and essentially boosting productivity in the development cycle.
